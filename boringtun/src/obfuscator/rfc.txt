   Figure 6 shows an example of a connection with a 0-RTT handshake and
   a single packet of 0-RTT data.  Note that as described in
   Section 12.3, the server acknowledges 0-RTT data in 1-RTT packets,
   and the client sends 1-RTT packets in the same packet number space.

                     Figure 6: Example 0-RTT Handshake


   The Destination Connection ID field from the first Initial packet
   sent by a client is used to determine packet protection keys for
   Initial packets.  These keys change after receiving a Retry packet;
   see Section 5.2 of [QUIC-TLS].

   The client populates the Source Connection ID field with a value of
   its choosing and sets the Source Connection ID Length field to
   indicate the length.

   0-RTT packets in the first flight use the same Destination Connection
   ID and Source Connection ID values as the client's first Initial
   packet.

   Upon first receiving an Initial or Retry packet from the server, the
   client uses the Source Connection ID supplied by the server as the
   Destination Connection ID for subsequent packets, including any 0-RTT
   packets.  This means that a client might have to change the
   connection ID it sets in the Destination Connection ID field twice
   during connection establishment: once in response to a Retry packet
   and once in response to an Initial packet from the server.  Once a
   client has received a valid Initial packet from the server, it MUST
   discard any subsequent packet it receives on that connection with a
   different Source Connection ID.

   A client MUST change the Destination Connection ID it uses for
   sending packets in response to only the first received Initial or
   Retry packet.  A server MUST set the Destination Connection ID it
   uses for sending packets based on the first received Initial packet.
   Any further changes to the Destination Connection ID are only
   permitted if the values are taken from NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames; if
   subsequent Initial packets include a different Source Connection ID,
   they MUST be discarded.  This avoids unpredictable outcomes that
   might otherwise result from stateless processing of multiple Initial
   packets with different Source Connection IDs.
